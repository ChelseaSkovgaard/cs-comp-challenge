# Static Comp Challenge

The static comp challenge was to use HTML/CSS to recreate a static comp. The challenge was to recreate the comp but there was freedom to select different colors, copy, and images. Link to original assignment: http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html

To make this challenge fun, I decided to make it carrot themed.
