# cs-comp-challenge-1

The static comp challenge is the first in a series of three challenges to use HTML/CSS to recreate a static comp.
There is not creative license but there is creative license in color, copy, images, and color palette. 
To make this challenge fun, I decided to make it carrot themed.
